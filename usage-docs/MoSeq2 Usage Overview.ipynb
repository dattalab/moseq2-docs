    " - moseq2-viz\n",
    " - moseq2-batch\n",

    "MoSeq2 is designed to be used in a sequential end-to-end fashion: once the 3D data is collected, users can then perform many different exploratory analysis techniques such as ROI analysis, PCA, and data vizualization. Examples for usage of each tool will be outlined in separate jupyter notebooks (linked above)."
