   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to the moseq2-viz documentation
=======================================

Just like the other MoSeq-related packages our lab developed, ``moseq2-viz``
provides two methods of interaction: the command-line interface (CLI) or
the application-programming interface (API). Most users will stick with
the CLI, but if your needs require a more custom approach to ask a
scientific question, check out the API.
